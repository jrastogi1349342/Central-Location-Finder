This is a predictive tool for optimal meeting locations for groups of individuals by optimizing driving distances and minimizing drive times, accounting for traffic. 

All personal information in this project (eg. addresses, API key) was stored in a class called Constants and removed from this version uploaded to Github. To use the tool, you must make an account with [HERE]([url](https://www.here.com/)) and form an API key. You can enter as many locations as desired, though I have not tested the program with any locations outside of the US. In addition, it defaults to the fastest route to get from point A to point B, which you can modify as desired.
